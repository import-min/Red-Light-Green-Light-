# Red Light, Green Light!👧🏻🚦

Welcome to **Red Light, Green Light!**, a Squid Game–inspired mini-game built with Python and Pygame using the Gamebox library. Dodge deadly stares, collect coins, and reach the finish line... or face elimination.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Press `M`** to begin the game.
- Use the **arrow keys** (`←`, `→`) to move left and right.
- **Hold `SPACE`** to run forward.
- But beware... when the doll turns around, **any movement = instant game over**.
- **Avoid rocks and logs** (they drain health).
- **Collect health and timer coins** to survive longer.
- Cross the **red finish line** at the top to win!
